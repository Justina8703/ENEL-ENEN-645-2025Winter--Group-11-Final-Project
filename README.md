## ABSTRACT/SUMMARY

This study presents an automated approach for brain tumor segmentation using a deep learning framework, employing a U-Net architecture on the publicly available brain tumor dataset. The motivation behind this work arises from the pressing need for accurate tumor detection methods in the field of medical imaging. Manual segmentation, being labor-intensive and error-prone, often results in suboptimal and inconsistent identification of tumor boundaries. By leveraging the power of deep convolutional neural networks and innovative architectural designs such as U-Net, our methodology is aimed at delivering competitive segmentation performance with acceptable computational efficiency, yielding a true dice coefficient of 0.68. In our experiments, we observe that, while the approach reliably captures the key features of the brain tumors, challenges remain in handling variations in tumor morphology, image noise, and class imbalance. Overall, our study highlights the potential of deep learning approaches for critical clinical applications, while also outlining several avenues for future research and model optimization
